## Adding Compositions

Compositions are a way to render your component so as to demonstrate that component for other developers looking to use it, and non-developers, such as designers and product managers, looking to inspect it.

Adding compositions to a component is done by creating a file in the component's directory, using the `*.composition.*` pattern.

For example:

```bash {3}
└── ui/button
    ├── index.tsx
    ├── button.composition.tsx
    └── button.tsx
```

You can create various compositions to showcase different usages of your component.

Basic Button:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from './button';

export const BasicButton = () => {
  return <Button text="click me" />;
};
```

Primary Button:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from './button';

export const PrimaryButton = () => {
  return <Button type="primary" text="click me" />;
};
```
