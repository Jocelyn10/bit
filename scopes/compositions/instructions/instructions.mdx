## No compositions found

View components in any context you choose or incorporate it into separate standalone "apps" to validate its behavior in different situations.

Create a file in the component directory with `.compositions.tsx/jsx` suffix.

```shell
touch --path/to/component/dir--/--component-name--.composition.tsx/jsx
```

Import the component, and any other relevant component or dependency, to the newly created compositions file, and use it to build a composition and export it with a named export. Each named export will be rendered as a separate composition, and you can create multiple composition files per component.

```js
import React from 'react'; // if using React
import { MyComponent } from './my-component';

export const BasicComposition = () => {
  return <MyComponent />;
};
```

Save the file to complete the process.
