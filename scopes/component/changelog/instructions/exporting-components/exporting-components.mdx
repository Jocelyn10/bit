# Exporting Components

When we version or 'tag' a component, we commit changes and prepare it to be exported to a remote scope. This process most often includes compiling and testing, as well.

## Tag a component

```bash
bit tag <component-id> --patch --message "this is the tag message"
```

### Tag all components that have been modified

Tag all components and bump the patch number of each component version

```bash
bit tag --all
```

## Export a Component
