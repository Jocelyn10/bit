## No tests found

Bit watches code and dependency changes and runs component tests to validate they are still working as expected.

To test **component** with **jest** create spec file(s) in the component directory with `.specs.tsx/jsx` suffix.

```shell
touch path/to/component/dir/component-name.specs.tsx/jsx
```

It is highly recommended to use the component compositions as test samples.
Each block will be rendered as a test case, and you can create multiple tests per component.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { BasicComposition } from './my-component.composition';

it('should render with the correct text', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<BasicComposition />);
  const rendered = getByText('hello');
  expect(rendered).toBeTruthy();
});
```

Save the file to complete the process.
