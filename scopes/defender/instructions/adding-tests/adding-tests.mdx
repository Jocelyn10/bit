## How to Add Tests

> Adding tests to a component is done by creating a file in the component's directory, using `*.spec.[ts|tsx|js|jsx]` or `*.test.[ts|tsx|js|jsx]`.

The local dev server watches your components for any changes and reruns tests for your component and all its dependents for you.

```bash{5}
├── ui/button
    ├── index.tsx
    ├── button.spec.tsx
    └── button.tsx
```

It is highly recommended to use the component compositions as test samples.

```tsx {4} title="button.tsx"
import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Button } from './button.composition';

it('should render with the correct text', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<BasicButton />);
  const rendered = getByText('click me');
  expect(rendered).toBeTruthy();
});
```
