## Adding Tests

Tests are added by placing test files inside the component's directory. Test files should be named with the pattern set by the component environment.

For example, the React environment runs tests in files named with the following pattern: `*.spec.[ts|tsx|js|jsx]` and `*.test.[ts|tsx|js|jsx]`

```bash {5}
├── ui/button
    ├── index.tsx
    ├── button.compositions.tsx
    ├── button.docs.mdx
    ├── button.spec.tsx
    └── button.tsx
```

It is highly recommended to use the component compositions as test samples.

```tsx {4} title="button.tsx"
import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { BasicButton } from './button.composition';

describe('button', () => {
  it('should render', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<BasicButton />);
    const rendered = getByText('click me');

    expect(rendered).to.exist;
  });
});
```

The local dev server watches your components for any changes and reruns tests for your component and all its dependents for you.
